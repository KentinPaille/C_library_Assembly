# C_library_Assembly

This project was an assembly project from my second year at EPITECH (2022-2023)

The goal was to create a **dynamic ELF library** to replace some of the [standard C library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) functions.

Compilation: **on GNU/Linux via Makefile**

Assembly files are compiled with the [**nasm assembler**](https://www.nasm.us/).
